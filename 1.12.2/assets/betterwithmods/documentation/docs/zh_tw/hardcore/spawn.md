# Hardcore Spawn

This feature reworks how death works. On initially joining a world the player spawn at the World Spawn, but any proceeding deaths the player will spawn randomly with in a 2000 block radius of the World Spawn. 

In the event of frequent deaths one will continue to spawn at the previous position. 

## Reasoning
This feature is intended to give a larger impact on death, as well as require players to develop infrastructure throughout their world in order to find their main base.
