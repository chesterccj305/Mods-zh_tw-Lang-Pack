Parasaurolophus, the "Near Crested
Lizard," was a very nasally
ornithopod, making it an odd but
well-liked dinosaur in the eyes of
its adoring fans. With an estimated
length of nine and a half meters and
a maximum height of three-to-four
meters, it was a heavily-built
dinosaur that could switch between
bipedal and quadrupedal postures at
will. Its odd crest is a point of
interest to fans and scientists
alike, with multiple hypothesized
functions. For both sexes, the
crest likely acted as a sign of
recognition between members of
herds. For males specifically,
though, it was probably for
attracting potential mates. Its
crest may also have helped with
thermoregulation, depending on if
there was a flap of skin connecting
the crest to the head or not. It may
have also served as a resonating
chamber used for producing loud and
low bellows, which could alert all
members of a herd to danger.

Roaming North America during the
Cretaceous, Parasaurolophus lived
along fellow herbivores like
Corythosaurus and carnivores like
Gorgosaurus. It grinded plants
in a chewing-like motion, with its
beak cropping plant matter while
its cheeks holding it firmly in its
mouth. Parasaurolophus fed upon
plants of varying heights due to
its range of postures.
