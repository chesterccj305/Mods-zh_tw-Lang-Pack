$title Monkey Wrench
$recipe wrench
The Monkey Wrench is the universal tool for adjusting machines. Right-clicking most machines and automation components will rotate them. It can also be used as a weapon, albeit a poor one.

$title Magnifying Glass
$recipe magglass
Right-click on a machine or similar block with a Magnifying Glass to see the contents of its fluid storage (if any), its installed upgrade, and the side from which it receives parts.

$title Safety Gear

$recipe deco/armor_safetyvest
$recipe deco/armor_workpants
$recipe deco/armor_steeltoeboots
Hard hats, safety vests, work pants, and steel-toed boots can be crafted for protection from monsters. The set is functionally identical to iron armour, but it looks much more appropriate for engineers.

$title Crafting Slot Blocker
$recipe automation/craftblocker
Crafting Slot Blockers can be put into the grid of the Autocrafter. They are ignored by it but still take up an inventory slot in order to ease automation.

$brief %rednotifier% Signals Redstone Watchers.
$brief %redwatcher% Listens for a linked Notifier to be signalled.
$recipe automation/rednotifier
$recipe automation/redwatcher

$title Hand Pump
$recipe handpump
The Hand Pump is essentially a bigger bucket. Right-click a liquid source block with it to fill; right-click any other block to empty.
It's best not to think about the implications of shoving 8 cubic meters of water into a handheld pump.

$title Element Sword
$recipe elementsword
Attaching a Heating Element to a Circuit Board and mounting it on a shaft makes a decent weapon. It has equal damage and durability to an iron sword and sets mobs on fire for 6 seconds.
Keep in mind that it's essentially an exposed electrical cable on a stick, so holding it while in water is not advised.

$title Pressure Gun
$recipe pressuregun
The Pressure Gun uses filled tanks of fluid as a weapon. It has different range, damage, and knockback depending on the contents of the tank, detailed on the next page.
It doesn't seem to affect squids at all - in fact, it almost seems like it was designed by them.
