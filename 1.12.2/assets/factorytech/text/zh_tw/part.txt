$title Stone Parts
$recipe parts/gear_stone
$recipe parts/drill_stone
Simple mechanical parts can be fashioned from stone instead of metal. However, given the primitive age of the material, stone parts last for only a few operations in machines; furthermore, any machine using them will have its speed halved.
Furthermore, machines using stone parts will also be unable to do some recipes. They are good for starting out, but not advised for long-term use.

$title Basic Motor
$recipe parts/basic_motor
These low-power motors are used in entry-level machines. They are not put under enough stress to break, but they simply don't have enough oomph to do anything advanced.
$end
$title Saw Blade
The Saw Blade is used in machines such as the Chop Saw that make big, imprecise cuts. It dulls overtime and must be replaced, but some used ones can be re-sharpened on the Grindstone. It itself is made by putting a Gear on a Grindstone.
$end
$title Basic Gear
Gears are used to change the ratio of torque to speed in rotational systems (apparently a dragon once wrote a great deal about the subject). They are made by machining an Iron Ingot on a Metal Cutter.
$end
$title Standard Wire
Copper wires are used to transmit electrical energy in machines such as the Electroplater and Electric Furnace. They burn out, but used ones can be smelted down into a few Copper nuggets.
They are made by processing copper ingots in a Metal Cutter; one ingot is good for two lengths of wire.
$end
$title Nickel Cutting Blade
Putting a nickel ingot to a grindstone yields a hard, sharp blade capable of cutting metal and doing more precise work than a saw blade. They dull over time, of course, but can usually be re-sharpened.
$end
$title Mixing Blades
$recipe parts/mixer
Mixing blades are used to churn liquids. They are rather expensive to make (requiring one nickel and four iron ingots) and cannot be salvaged, but they usually last a long time in machines.
$end
$title Wooden Grate
$recipe parts/mesh
Simple but effective, grates are used to filter large objects from smaller ones; the River Grate in particular uses them to catch metal nuggets. Being made of wood, they are rather flimsy.
$end
$title Shaft
$recipe parts/shaft
Although most machines use shafts of some sort, the majority are not put under enough stress to need replacing. However, some machines that deal with significant rotary power can bend or break their axles; these can be smelted down to reclaim a bit of iron.
Sadly, blueprints for the bedrock-alloy design have been lost to time.
$end
$title Advanced Motor
$recipe parts/motor
When simple integrated motors don't cut it, Advanced Motors provide significantly more power. Automating the production of Advanced Motors is the gateway to being able to use a good chunk of the machines. However, many of their applications put them under heavy load which can burn them out. Dead motors can be disassembled to reclaim the Redstone used in their production.
$end
$title Drill
The Drill does exactly what you would expect, drilling holes in things. It is the main component of the Drill Grinder, Fluid Drill, and Mining Machine, all core components to set up. To make it, run a Nickel Ingot through a Metal Cutter and then sharpen it on a Grindstone.
$end
$title Heating Element
$recipe parts/heatelem
Heating Elements, used in machines that require high temperatures, is made using cupronickel alloy ingots (obtained by crafting 3 copper dust with 1 nickel dust and smelting the result). Due to their nature, they take awhile to burn out, and then they can be reclaimed for some of the metal.
$end
$title Circuit Board
The Circuit Board is one of the most important parts described in this manual, and is used in virtually all complex machines. Producing them is a multi-step process that will be described on the next page. When they burn out, the board can be smelted to clean it, destroying the copper but refreshing the board.
$page
First, a Block of Quartz must be cut up in a Chop Saw. This yields six Blank Quartz Plates. Then, a Circuit Scribe must be programmed with one of four patterns to etch onto the plate, and a plate must be processed on it. Once a pattern has been cut, the grooves must be filled with Red Copper Dust (Copper + Redstone) or Glowing Gold Dust (Gold + Glowstone), and the filled circuit board must be smelted to finish it.

$title Magnet
Magnets are used in many machines that interact with the world. In addition, they are a crucial component of charging and stabilizing Energy Cores. They are also unique in that, since their only effect from use is de-magnetizing, you can reclaim the Iron Ingot 100% of the time in all machines that use them.
Automatically collecting them may be wise.
$end
$title Battery
Most machines can run off of simple Redstone power, but some require a substantial electrical current. Batteries are created by first crafting the empty shell, and then using a Compression Chamber to fill them with sulphuric acid. Adding a copper and a gold nugget to a dead battery refurbishes the shell.
$end
$title Focusing Lens
Focusing lenses can be obtained by putting a Glass block on a Grindstone. They are used in the Temperance Chamber to achieve a precise temperature.
$end
$title Integrated Piston
$recipe parts/intpiston
These pistons, which have been adapted for use in machinery, are used in many machines that deal with manufacturing or otherwise back-and-forth motion. They wear out from repeated use, but the Redstone inside them can usually be reclaimed.
$end
$title Energy Core
$recipe core_assembly
This piece of cutting-edge technology comes straight from the Mad Professor himself. It radiates raw energy and was designed to allow this energy to be tapped in many different ways. Automating the production of these is no small feat, but many machines will ravenously gobble up their power. The method of producing them is detailed on the next page.
$page
The first step to manufacturing an Energy Core is to drill a hole in a block of Obsidian using the Drill Grinder. Next, it must be outfitted with two Pattern 2 Circuit Boards and lined with lapis lazuli to aid in energy balance. Finally, as the actual energy storage medium, it must be filled with Energite in the Compression Chamber.
$page
The filled core is now ready to be charged in a Core Charging Table. It is important to note that the optimal charge level is 80% - any more or less than that will interfere with the final step, and attempting to charge it past 100% will install a nice new crater in your base.
$page
At this point, the core is brimming with power but is too volatile to be used. To stabilize it, it must be set into a Stabilization Unit and surrounded by four Redstone Magnets, two blocks away from the unit in the four cardinal directions. These magnets require an alternating Redstone current to build up a field, with stronger fields having a faster effect.
$page
Several things can go wrong during energy core stabilization. First, the magnetic field strengths must all be approximately equal - if they are uneven, the magnetic field imbalance will actually decrease the core's stability. Second, if a magnet is overcharged, it will "fizzle", negating its field and preventing it from regaining it for five seconds. Third, if stability drops too low, the core will explode. Violently.
