$title Copper
Valued for its malleability and conductivity, copper is used in pipes and electrical components. It can be found below Y=48 about as commonly as iron.

$title Nickel
Nickel is similar to iron in many ways, but is harder and tougher. It is useful as a pure metal, but can also be alloyed with iron or copper. It occurs uncommonly below Y=24.

$title Monster Dust
This unsettling powder seems to be derived from monsters. Killing them by normal means does not yield any, but the Mob Disassembler can harvest one pile per monster processed.
It can be mixed with liquefied Glowstone and sulphuric acid to produce Energite.

$title Sulphur
Sulphur is obtained as a liquid using the Fluid Drill. It forms sulphuric acid when mixed with water in an Agitator, and thus is crucial for high-tech industry. It also reacts to Redstone to produce Blaze Powder.

$title Propane
Propane, while technically a gas, is dense enough that it flows as a liquid for most purposes. It is obtained with the Fluid Drill, and can be compressed into tanks for fast smelting in the Propane Furnace. Because of its flammability, using a propane tank with the Fluid Pressure Gun makes it into a flamethrower.

$title Energite
The reaction of Glowstone and sulphuric acid with Monster Dust produces substantial latent energy. It reacts strongly to electric current and magnetic fields, and is the key component of Energy Cores.
